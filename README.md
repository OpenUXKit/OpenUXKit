# OpenUXKit

OpenUXKit is an open source implementation of Apple's UXKit PrivateFramework

The project is for the following purposes:
- Build similar to UIKit interface on non-Apple platform (eg. GNUStep)
- Bringing missing components to the macOS platform (e.g. NavigationController)

And the API design is to stay the same as the original UXKit API.

Currently, this project is in early development.
